# UCB_Challenge_6

Created a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. Used the citipy Python libraryLinks to an external site., the OpenWeatherMap APILinks to an external site., and problem-solving skills that created a representative model of weather across cities. Used WeatherPy.ipynb Jupyter notebook provided in the starter code ZIP file.

Created plots to showcase the relationship between weather variables and latitude:
Latitude vs. Temperature
Latitude vs. Humidity
Latitude vs. Cloudiness
Latitude vs. Wind Speed

Computed linear regression for each relationship. Separated the plots into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude):
Northern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude
Southern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude
Northern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude
Southern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude
Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude
Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude
Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude
Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude
